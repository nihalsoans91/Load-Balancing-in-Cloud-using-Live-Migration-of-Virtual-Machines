# Load Balancing in Cloud using Live Migration of Virtual Machines
In this project, we have implemented a cloud architecture which consists of Xen Cloud Platform enabled servers with virtual machines installed on each server, a network file system and client machines which support remote connection. We conducted experiments by generating load using load generating tools such as stress, lookbusy and CPUbusy. Based on the experiments conducted, we have observed that the load balancing algorithm, by using the features of scaling and migration has considerably improved the performance of the virtual machine in terms of response time and in terms of usage of CPU resources. Certain problems that were encountered during the course of the project dealt with incongruity of processor architecture, the need of a network file system server for live migration, absence of Para-virtualization drivers on most of the Linux kernels, the need to switch from Citrix XenCenter to XCP because of certain restrictions placed by Citrix.
Now that we have been successful in migrating a virtual machine from one XCP platform to another XCP platform, it seems feasible in implementing the migration of a virtual machine to a completely different platform such as KVM, VMware. We can also consider the possibility of migrating a virtual machine based on power consumption as well as based on past usage history in the future.
